# What is SakitinSU?

<mark>SakitinSU</mark> (short for <mark>SakiSU/SKTSU/SSU</mark>) is a kernel-level Root solution named after the core member [@安音咲汀](https://github.com/TianwanTW) of the Overflowing Memories Working Group <mark>[(OOM. WG.)](https://oom-wg.dev)</mark>.

SakitinSU aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use kernel-level Root permission management tool for Android devices. It is a new Root solution following `Magisk`, `KernelSU`, and `APatch`, and like `KernelSU`, it runs in kernel mode, granting Root permissions to user-space applications directly in the kernel space.

## Disclaimer

<u>**We do not compete with other `ROOT implementations`, and we are not interested in the petty interpersonal issues.
So no matter what others say, we hope you won't mind, just choose what you want, use what you find useful.**</u>
