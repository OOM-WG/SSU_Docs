WG.</code> explicitly stated in posts that it is not a <code>KernelSU</code> branch. Jumping to conclusions is premature. <code>SSU</code> is still under development, and the root implementation needs to wait for the kernel space implementation code&#39;s development progress.</p><p>Although <code>SSU</code> is also a kernel-based root implementation, this does not imply a direct connection between the projects. Overlapping in certain technical implementations is a normal phenomenon, but over-interpreting this overlap is meaningless.</p><p>Some people say it&#39;s a <code>KernelSU</code> API shell, but <code>KernelSU</code> does not have any universal APIs. All of <code>SSU</code>&#39;s code is for general development targeting various module-based root implementations. Furthermore, <code>SSU</code> is primarily a <code>Kotlin</code> project, and most of the code is implemented using <code>Kotlin</code>&#39;s <code>JVM/Native</code>. Only a small portion of the code, which <code>Kotlin</code> cannot implement, is implemented in <code>C++</code>. While other root implementations mostly use <code>Kotlin/Java</code> for application development and <code>C++/Rust</code> for user space tools, claiming <code>SSU</code> is a <code>Fork</code> is purely unfounded.</p><p>Moreover, if you follow <code>SSU</code>&#39;s historical updates and delve into the specific update content, you will find that <code>SSU</code> gradually implemented <code>SU CLI</code>, general operations, and general module installations. These are merely preparatory steps for subsequent features, and they are not included in the update logs.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to “Conclusion”">​</a></h2><p>We will ignore negative voices. <code>SSU</code> will be a highly independent implementation, not a pie in the sky. It is expected to achieve kernel space implementation before the end of <code>July</code>. Stay tuned.</p>',10)),n(c),n(p)])}const w=m(S,[["render",g]]);export{P as __pageData,w as default};
